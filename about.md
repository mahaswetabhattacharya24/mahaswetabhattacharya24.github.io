### From India to the United States

I began my academic journey in **Kolkata, India**, a city known for its rich intellectual tradition, artistic heritage, and the unmatched energy of **Durga Puja**, which continues to be one of my strongest cultural anchors. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in **Electronics and Communication Engineering**, a period that shaped my early fascination with signals, systems, and the broader world of computation. After graduation, I worked briefly at **Cognizant Technology Solutions** in Kolkata, gaining my first exposure to real-world engineering workflows and large-scale technology environments.

Driven by a desire to deepen my technical foundation and explore research more seriously, I moved to the United States to pursue a **Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering at the University at Buffalo (SUNY)**. That transition marked the true beginning of my scientific journey—one that eventually led me from engineering to neuroscience, and later to biomedical AI and drug discovery. In many ways, the move was not just geographic but transformative, opening doors to new fields, ideas, and collaborations that have shaped my career ever since.

### About Me

I am a Senior Scientist at **Sanofi Research** in Cambridge, MA, where I build AI-driven, multimodal computational frameworks for drug–target discovery across immunology and complex disease. My work spans *machine learning, large-scale genetics, molecular phenotyping, and evidence synthesis*, with a focus on designing systems that translate heterogeneous biomedical data into actionable therapeutic hypotheses.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering** from the University at Buffalo, SUNY, where I specialized in large-scale neural data modeling, connectomics, and computational neuroscience. Following my doctoral studies, I completed a **postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine**, developing high-performance computational tools and reinforcement-learning–based optimization engines for precision radiation therapy.

At Sanofi, I lead or contribute to multiple initiatives involving multimodal foundation models, graph-based target ranking engines, and automated LLM-driven evidence curation pipelines that support portfolio-level decisions. My broader interest lies in building **scalable, reliable AI systems** that solve real-world problems—whether in science, healthcare, or large-scale technology environments.

I am passionate about integrating human biology with data science, and I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI, multi-omics, drug discovery, and complex-system modeling**.
