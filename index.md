### About Me
I am a Senior Scientist at Sanofi in Cambridge, MA, where I develop AI-driven, multimodal models and computational frameworks for drug-target discovery across immunology and complex disease. I earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, where my research focused on large-scale neural data modeling, connectomics, and computational neuroengineering. Following my doctoral work, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, developing high-performance computational tools and reinforcement-learning frameworks for radiation therapy optimization. I am passionate about building scalable, reliable AI systems that solve complex real-world problems—whether in scientific discovery, healthcare, or large-scale technology environments.
